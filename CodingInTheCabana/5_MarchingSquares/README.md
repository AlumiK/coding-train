# #5 Marching Squares

Marching squares is a computer graphics algorithm that generates contours for a two-dimensional scalar field (rectangular array of individual numerical values). A similar method can be used to contour 2D triangle meshes.

The contours can be of two kinds:

- Isolines – lines following a single data level, or isovalue.
- Isobands – filled areas between isolines.

Typical applications include the contour lines on topographic maps or the generation of isobars for weather maps.
